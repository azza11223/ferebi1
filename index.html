    <p class="text">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the 
        industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, <br>when an unknown printer took a galley of type
         and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the 
         leap into <br> electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
         with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br>and more recently with desktop 
         publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum
